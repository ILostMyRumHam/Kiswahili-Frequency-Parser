# Kiswahili Frequency Parser
Python script for JSON serialization and parsing of data from a list of 10,000 most frequently used Swahili words and their approximate English equivalents

To use the script, clone the repository or download the root directory. Then run main.py inside an Integrated Development Environment of your choosing.
If you wish to run the script using Python Shell, you can put something like this line at the end of the main.py file to read the entries:
>input('Press ENTER to exit')

(Wait for input before the programme closes itself inside of Shell)
# Source

The list of words I used as a source can be found here:

I am not responsible for the accuracy of the original list and cannot make any assurances about its truthfulness.

# Updates

- [x] The JSON serialization should be working as of today (12.08.2025) so there should be no need to work with the raw pdf anymore.
