# Swahili-Frequency-Parser
Python script for JSON serialization and parsing of data from a list of 10,000 most frequently used Swahili words and their approximate English equivalents

The list of words I used as a source can be found here:
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/373953169_Frequency_list_of_Swahili_10_000_most_common_words_1

I am not responsible for the accuracy of the original list and cannot make any assurances about its truthfulness.

The JSON serialization should be working as of today (12.08.2025) so there should be no need to work with the raw pdf anymore.
