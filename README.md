# Swahili-Frequency-Parser
Python script for JSON serialization and parsing of data from a list of 10,000 most frequently used Swahili words and their approximate English equivalents

The list of words I used as a source can be found here:
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/373953169_Frequency_list_of_Swahili_10_000_most_common_words_1

I am not responsible for the accuracy of the original list and cannot make any assurances about its truthfulness.

In the current state for the parser to work properly you will need to download the pdf and copy it into the same directory as the parser + possibly change the file name inside swahili_json_init.py

TODO: Grab the information directly from the JSON file instead of the raw pdf
